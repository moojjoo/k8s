## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (for running local clusters)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moojjoo/k8s.git
   cd k8s
   ```

2. **Start a local cluster (using Minikube):**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

3. **Apply your first manifest:**
